# Redirect configurations
# Assuming you want to stop unnecessary redirects, ensure the server block
# does not include unwanted rewrite rules. Below is a simple example:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;  # Modify with your domain

    location / {
        # Assuming index.html as the primary document
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Further location blocks can be added as needed
    # Custom logging can be added here to debug requests
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    # Additional configurations can be set here
}
